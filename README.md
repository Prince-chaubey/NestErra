## 📖 About the Project

NestErra is a MERN-style (MongoDB, Express, Node.js, EJS) web app. It allows users to:

- View all available property listings.
- See detailed pages for each listing with description, price, and location.
- Add reviews to listings.
- (Admin/Owner) Create, update, and delete property listings.

The main goal of NestErra is to serve as a beginner-to-intermediate level full-stack project with proper routing, templating, and database interaction using Mongoose and MongoDB.
